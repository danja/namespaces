```prompt
Please create an OWL ontology to capture the following:
The pan ontology is designed to describe the subject area of interest, a subdomain of knowledge in a larger corpus. The name is used as an analogy to pan in the cinematographic sense, in which only a particular region of the world is visible in a particular moment in a scene, where the interest, attention lies. It contains a set of resources, pointing to core concepts and those around the fringes. It will contain a skos schema capturing the key ideas together with links to remote exemplary resources such as academic papers. It will have facets like a summary description, tags and keywords.

Please create an OWL ontology to capture the following:
The tilt ontology captures a series of parameters related to the corpuscle ontology to be used in information retrieval. It may favor similarities taken from embedding values or path length in RDF relations, or simple keyword coincidence.
It will be possible to give instance data using this ontology to identify a conceptual region in a knowledgebase.
